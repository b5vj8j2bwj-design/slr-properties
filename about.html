        <h2>SLR Properties</h2>
        <p>
          SLR Properties is a renovation-focused real estate company based in the Coachella Valley, with a deep appreciation for mid-century homes throughout Palm Springs and the surrounding desert communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m drawn to properties with strong architectural identity — clean lines, thoughtful layouts, and a real sense of place. Many of the homes I work on have incredible bones but need careful restoration and modern refinement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each renovation is approached with intention, patience, and attention to detail. The goal is always to honor the original architecture while adapting the home for modern living.
        </p>
